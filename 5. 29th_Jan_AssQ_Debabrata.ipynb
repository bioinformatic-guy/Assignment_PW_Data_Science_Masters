It is responsible for allocating memory for Python objects and data structures and freeing up the memory when it is no longer needed. The Python interpreter automatically tracks the objects that are no longer in use and releases the memory occupied by them. This makes memory management in Python much easier compared to other programming languages. Additionally, Python also has garbage collection that helps in reclaiming the memory that is no longer being used by the application."
