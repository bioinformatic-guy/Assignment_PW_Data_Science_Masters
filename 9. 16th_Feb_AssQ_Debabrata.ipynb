    "- Data Model:\n",
    "SQL databases are based on the relational data model, which means that the data is stored in tables with predefined schema, and the relationships between the tables are defined through foreign keys. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, have a more flexible data model that can be document-oriented, key-value, graph-based, or column-family based.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Scalability:\n",
    "SQL databases are vertically scalable, which means that they can handle an increase in workload by adding more processing power, memory, or storage capacity to the server. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are horizontally scalable, which means that they can handle an increase in workload by adding more servers to the database cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consistency:\n",
    "SQL databases are known for their strong consistency, which means that the data in the database is always in a valid state, and any transaction that modifies the data will be either completed or rolled back. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, may sacrifice consistency for scalability and partition tolerance, which means that there may be some eventual consistency issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Query Language:\n",
    "SQL databases use SQL as the standard language for querying and manipulating the data, which is a declarative language that specifies what data should be retrieved or modified. NoSQL databases use different query languages, depending on the type of database. For example, MongoDB uses a document-based query language, while Cassandra uses a CQL (Cassandra Query Language).\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific needs of your application. SQL databases are better suited for applications that require strong consistency, ACID transactions, and a fixed data schema. NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are better suited for applications that require high scalability, flexible data models, and eventual consistency."

    "A primary key and foreign key are both used to establish relationships between tables in a relational database. Here's a brief explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `Primary Key:`\n",
    "A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. Primary keys are used to enforce the integrity of the data in the table, as well as to establish relationships between tables. Each table can have only one primary key, and it cannot contain null values. Here's an example:\n",
    "Suppose we have two tables, \"customers\" and \"orders.\" The \"customers\" table has a primary key on the \"id\" column, and the \"orders\" table has a foreign key on the \"customer_id\" column. This allows us to establish a one-to-many relationship between the two tables, where each customer can have multiple orders. The primary key in the \"customers\" table ensures that each row is uniquely identified, while the foreign key in the \"orders\" table references the primary key in the \"customers\" table to establish the relationship between the two tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `Foreign Key:`\n",
    "A foreign key is a column or set of columns in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. Foreign keys are used to establish relationships between tables, and they ensure that the data in one table is consistent with the data in another table. The foreign key column must contain only values that exist in the primary key of the other table. Here's an example:\n",
    "Suppose we have two tables, \"orders\" and \"products.\" The \"orders\" table has a foreign key on the \"product_id\" column, which references the primary key on the \"id\" column in the \"products\" table. This allows us to establish a one-to-many relationship between the two tables, where each order can have only one product. The foreign key in the \"orders\" table ensures that each \"product_id\" value corresponds to a valid \"id\" value in the \"products\" table."
